Hello, world! üåç

I'm a self-taught newbie, stepping into the fascinating world of coding and development. My journey began thanks to the inspiration I drew from the game Cyberpunk 2077. This game opened my eyes to the incredible possibilities in the tech world, and I decided to dive right in.

### About Me
- **Learning Enthusiast**: I'm currently at the scripting level, but I'm constantly learning and improving.
- **Cyberpunk Dreamer**: My goal is to immerse myself in the cyber world and make meaningful contributions to the Cyberpunk universe.

### Goals
- **Self-Improvement**: To hone my coding skills and grow from a beginner to a proficient developer.
- **Community Contribution**: To contribute my knowledge and skills to the Cyberpunk community and beyond.

### Projects
I am currently working on small projects and scripts as part of my learning process. Stay tuned for more updates!
